# Study Notebooks

This project is a compilation of study and review notebooks related to data science, based on the [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) lean path.<br>
Every directory has a notebook, some pictures or files needed for the examples and a PDF that resumes the topic.<br>
*Those PDF's are owned by the dataquest and it owns all the rights over them.*
