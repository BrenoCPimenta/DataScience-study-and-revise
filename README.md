# Study Notebooks

This project is a compilation of study and review notebooks related to data science, based on the [dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) website.<br><br>
**Content:** Every directory has a notebook, some pictures or files needed for the examples and a PDF that resumes the topic. You will notice that there are some numbers missing, this is due to some topics that have been removed or relocated, others because they are projects and so on.<br>
**License:** *Those PDF's are owned by the dataquest and all the rights over them.*
